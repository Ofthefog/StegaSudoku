# StegaSudoku
A proposed method of transfering arbitrary files via unsolved sudoku puzzles

Software will take hexcode or simple text, map this to a solved sudoku puzzle, add a given number of rule systems to minimize numbers needed to solve the puzzle, and output an image of an unsolved puzzle or simply the coordinates and ruleset ( minimised to a few letters to further reduce transfer file size ).
